v21

## Changes

* Support passing along a GitHub OIDC Token ID to nixbuild.net for use in
  [authorization policies](https://docs.nixbuild.net/access-control/#jwt_claim).
  Enabled by setting the new option `oidc` to `true`, and ensuring your job has
  an `id-token: write` permission.

* ci-workflow: Make the GHA runner type configurable.

* ci-workflow: Replace the `flake_directory` setting with `flake`. This means
  that you can now point ci-workflow to a flake in another repository.

* ci-workflow: Add a `nix_args` setting.

* ci-workflow: Make it possible to skip Nix installation.

* ci-workflow: Bump `nix-quick-install-action` to the latest release ([v33](https://github.com/nixbuild/nix-quick-install-action/releases/tag/v33)).
